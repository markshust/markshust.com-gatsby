Ever since I decided to integrate Firebase into a production app about a year and a half ago, I've been completely intrigued by the real-time web; I believe it can be applied to just about any industry for any purpose with great benefit.

I'm now turning my needs for an advanced reporting tool over to Keen.io, whom I've been following for just about a year now. There is some great synergy between Firebase and Keen.io going on, and I thought that Firebase could solve a problem that Keen.io has of dashboards & charts not being real-time. There are so many potential use-cases out there that could really use a real-time reporting solution as a great asset.

I contacted Keen.io to get a general run-down of their services, as I've just been a passively following their service up until now. Justin at Keen.io was very helpful, and provided me with some direction of integrating Firebase to some extent, which could add some real-time capabilities to their data. Due to my previous history with Firebase this was right up my alley, and I was excited to setup an example use-case of this setup. Hope this post helps out some others as well!
